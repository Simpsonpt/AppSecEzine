# AppSec Ezine

Raising awareness towards the prevention of security risks is challenging. Most people are unaware of or just don’t have access to the right information. Keeping up the pace in the tech world is a golden rule. If you are not ready to deal with security issues, you are heading in the wrong direction.

The AppSec Ezine was born out of the need to curate contents concerning information security that otherwise one may find scattered across the web. Each edition covers a wide range of topics. The AppSec Ezine is focussed on providing information about problems you should be aware of (old or new issues) and giving you an overview of the latest hot topics - curiosities that get you through your daily work or ignite your passion on the topic.

There are no prerequisites to reading the AppSec Ezine. It is for wannabes, n00bs, l33ts or gurus. No matter if you are the very best of your field or just someone interested in security, you will still find something new and cool to learn. 

**The Ezine is divided into four sections:**  

* "Must See - Something that is really worth your time!"  
  The latest write-up of a bounty given by a major site, some dumb bug that was reported and still was rewarded, the latest trend in the infosec world or just something cool/useful to know.
* "Hack - Some Kung Fu Techniques."  
  Sharing is caring. Being ready to use the best tool for the job is a must. This section provides ways to make your life easier. Even if you don't totally understand the big picture, your starting point will never be null. 
* "Security - All about security issues/problems."  
  Under the umbrella security, this section covers forensics, malware analysis, advanced exploitation techniques, more bug bounties, vulnerabilities research, some nice OS features that can be "misused”, cool techniques, and so on and so forth.
* "Fun -  Do you have spare time?"  
  Open these links if you want to check some cool stuff, get your hands dirty on something witty, try new tech or just to have a nice time trying something out of the box. Remember that it may not always be related to security.

This project started inside a company and was used to spread infosec culture around. If you have a security program running, mailing list or any group that think this will be welcome, feel free to use and redistribute. It will be released every week usually on a Friday morning via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/simps0n "@SiMpS0N").
